# Clout9
Final project for SD program

3. Technology Stack:
- Front End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Back End: Node.js with Express
- Database: Firebase
- Source Control: Git
- Hosting: Firebase

4. Initial Features and User Stories:
- Feature 1: User Registration and Login
  - User Story: As a user, I want to register and log in to access the Clout9 platform. 

- Feature 2: Post Creation and Display
  - User Story: As a user, I want to create short text posts and see them displayed on a timeline.

5. Source Control Technology:
GitHub

6. Deployment Platform:
Heroku

7. Meeting Minimum Project Requirements:
- Front End: The front end will consist of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple user interface for user registration, login, and post creation.
- Back End: We will use Node.js with Express to handle HTTP requests, route users, and manage post data.
- Database: For this basic version, we will store posts in memory within the application, avoiding the need for a database.
- User Authentication: Basic user authentication will be implemented with hard-coded usernames and passwords.
- Deployment: The application will be hosted on Heroku, making it accessible online for demonstration purposes.

8. Conclusion:
Clout9 is a fundamental microblogging platform that demonstrates the basics of user registration, login, and post creation. By using a simplified technology stack and a basic approach to user authentication, this project aims to provide an accessible introduction to web development concepts. As this project progresses (and after the project), I have the opportunity to expand its features and functionalities.
